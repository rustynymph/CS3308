	Going to use Jython
		Wikipedia pg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython
			good for general information ESP how it works
		Tutorial: http://www.jython.org/docs/tutorial/indexprogress.html
	Potential Issues with Jython:
		Jython and Python library support
			Library: Tkinter
				Found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4993400/does-jython-support-tkinter
				Leads to JyNI: http://www.jyni.org/
					Compatability layer to enable Jython to use CPython
					Stated to support Tkinter, though JyNI is still in development
