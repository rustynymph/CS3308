Notes for Android Implementation:

Python to Java
	Going to use Jython
		Wikipedia pg: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jython
			good for general information ESP how it works
	Potential Issues with Jython:
		Jython and Python library support
			Library: Tkinter
				Found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4993400/does-jython-support-tkinter
				Leads to JyNI: http://www.jyni.org/
					Compatability layer to enable Jython to use CPython
					Stated to support Tkinter, though JyNI is still in development

Running on Android
	Potential Issues:
		Android MySQL support?
			Yes?; found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15732853/how-to-connect-android-app-to-mysql-database
				Must get from a URL for this answer, so......will it work with ours?
			Also found this tutorial that may be helpful: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_php_mysql.htm
